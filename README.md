Stronghold: Kingdom Simulator
This project is a C++-based text-based kingdom management simulator, Stronghold: Kingdom Simulator, designed to model the governance of multiple kingdoms. The code simulates key aspects such as population dynamics, resource management, economy, military operations, politics, alliances, trade, and strategic movement on a grid-based map. It is built with modularity and extensibility in mind, leveraging advanced C++ concepts to ensure robust functionality and an engaging user experience.
The codebase is organized into modular classes: KingdomComponent (an abstract base class for components like Population, SocialStructure, Resources, Economy, Military, Politics, Banking, EventManager, Communication, Alliance, Market, and Map), Kingdom (manages a single kingdom's components), and KingdomManager (orchestrates multiple kingdoms and the game loop). Each component handles specific functionalities, such as population growth, resource production, or treaty negotiations, with interactions coordinated through the Kingdom class. The game supports up to four kingdoms, each with a unique ID, allowing players to switch between them to manage resources, engage in diplomacy, or wage wars.
The project utilizes standard C++ libraries (iostream, fstream, string, cstdlib, ctime, sstream) for input/output, file handling, and random number generation. It incorporates advanced C++ features:

Templates: The Resources class uses templates (e.g., Resources<int>) for type-safe management of resources like food, wood, and stone.
Operator Overloading: The Economy class overloads the += operator to simplify gold adjustments (e.g., economy += amount).
Exception Handling: The Population class employs a custom PopulationException to handle errors like negative population reductions, with try-catch blocks for robust error management.
Object-Oriented Principles: The code uses inheritance (components derive from KingdomComponent), polymorphism (via virtual functions like update and getStatus), and encapsulation (private data with public interfaces).

Additional features include color-coded console output for better user interaction, file-based logging (game_session_log.txt, SCORE_GAME.txt) for tracking events and scores, random events (e.g., disease, famine), and a 5x5 grid-based map for kingdom movement. The save/load system preserves game states, and the turn-based mechanics drive kingdom progression. My contribution involved designing and implementing the entire codebase, ensuring modularity, and integrating features like random events, alliances, and strategic map movement.
